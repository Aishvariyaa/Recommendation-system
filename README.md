# Recommendation System
This project develops a collaborative filtering-based movie recommendation system, aiming to suggest movies to users based on their past ratings and preferences. By loading and merging movie ratings and metadata datasets, preprocessing data into a user-movie matrix, and calculating cosine similarity between users, the system identifies similar rating patterns and generates recommendations. Using a user-based collaborative filtering approach, the system demonstrates the effectiveness of this method in building a simple yet effective recommendation system, with potential for future enhancements like incorporating additional features, exploring advanced techniques, and evaluating performanceÂ metrics.
